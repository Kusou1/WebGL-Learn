# Cesium Language (CZML) Guide

CZML is a JSON format for describing a time-dynamic graphical scene, primarily for display in a web browser running Cesium. It describes lines, points, billboards, models, and other graphical primitives, and specifies how they change with time. While Cesium has a rich client-side API, CZML allows it to be data-driven so that a generic Cesium viewer can display a rich scene without the need for any custom code. In many ways, the relationship between Cesium and CZML is similar to the relationship between Google Earth and KML. Both CZML and KML are data formats for describing scenes in their respective clients and are meant to be generated by a wide variety of applications and possibly even written by hand. And both are meant to be sufficiently client-agnostic that other, compatible clients can render the scene described therein. CZML has a number of important characteristics, some of which distinguish it from KML:

1. CZML is based on [JSON](http://www.json.org/).
2. CZML can accurately describe properties that change value over time. For example, a line can be red for one interval of time and blue for another. Clients are also expected to be able to interpolate over time-tagged samples. If the position of a vehicle is specified at two times, the client can accurately display the location of the vehicle in between those two times by using a CZML-specified interpolation algorithm. Every property is time-dynamic.
3. CZML is structured for efficient, incremental streaming to a client. The entire document need not be present on the client before the scene can be displayed. In many cases, individual clients may even join and leave the stream while it is in progress.
4. CZML is optimized for client consumption; it aims to be compact and easy to parse. It is also reasonably readable and writable by humans.
5. CZML is extensible. While the primary goal of CZML is to communicate a scene to a virtual-globe-like client, the format can easily be extended to communicate additional static or time-dynamic data to a more sophisticated client. For example, time-dynamic data could be displayed on a 2D chart.
6. CZML is an open format. We would like as many projects to take advantage of it as possible and hope to one day formalize with a standard body, such as [OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/).
7. An open-source library, [czml-writer](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer), for writing CZML is maintained on Github.

CZML 是一种 JSON 格式，用于描述时间动态图形场景，主要用于在运行 Cesium 的 Web 浏览器中显示。它描述线、点、广告牌、模型和其他图形基元，并指定它们如何随时间变化。虽然 Cesium 有丰富的客户端 API，但 CZML 允许它是数据驱动的，因此通用 Cesium 查看器可以显示丰富的场景，而无需任何自定义代码。在很多方面，Cesium 和 CZML 之间的关系类似于 Google Earth 和 KML 之间的关系。CZML 和 KML 都是用于描述其各自客户端中的场景的数据格式，旨在由各种应用程序生成，甚至可能是手写的。并且两者都意味着与客户端无关，其他兼容的客户端可以渲染其中描述的场景。

1. CZML 基于[JSON](http://www.json.org/)。
2. CZML 可以准确地描述随时间变化的属性。例如，一条线可以在一个时间间隔内为红色，而在另一个时间间隔内为蓝色。还期望客户能够对带有时间标签的样本进行插值。如果在两次指定车辆的位置，客户端可以通过使用 CZML 指定的插值算法准确显示这两次之间的车辆位置。每个属性都是时间动态的。
3. CZML 是为高效、增量流式传输到客户端而构建的。在可以显示场景之前，整个文档不需要出现在客户端上。在许多情况下，单个客户端甚至可以在流进行时加入和离开。
4. CZML 针对客户消费进行了优化；它旨在紧凑且易于解析。它也可以被人类合理地读写。
5. CZML 是可扩展的。虽然 CZML 的主要目标是将场景传达给类似虚拟地球的客户端，但可以轻松扩展格式以将额外的静态或时间动态数据传达给更复杂的客户端。例如，时间动态数据可以显示在二维图表上。
6. CZML 是一种开放格式。我们希望尽可能多的项目能够利用它，并希望有朝一日能够与[OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/)等标准机构正式合作。
7. Github 上维护了一个用于编写 CZML的开源库[czml-writer 。](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer)
